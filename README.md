# EDA_Highest_Grossing_Films


The purpose of this demo project is to determine which movies gross the highest as I speculate that weather has a large contriution on film sales.
The sources used to conduct this analysis can be found in the notebooks. 

Note: Southern Hemisphere didn't exist in the data which means this entire analysis truly only comprises of films in the US represented by both domestic and global sales. Introduction of the Southern Hemisphere was added to make it fun but it's totallyd devoid of sound logic as there were no indicators in the data to denote sales from the Southern Hemisphere. Just me having fun with data.
